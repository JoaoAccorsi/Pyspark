# Objective

PySpark is a Python API that supports Apache Spark, especially for large-scale data analysis.

The objective of this implementation consists of simulating PySpark capabilities. For that, a system to manage the grades of the students in a university has been implemented.

The data is stored in AWS S3, and each teacher accesses the data, building their own statics via PySpark, and saving into AWS S3 again.
